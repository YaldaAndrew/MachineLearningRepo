# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects covering deep learning, optimization, and classical ML algorithms. Each project demonstrates a different application of machine learning, from natural language processing to image classification and traditional classification techniques.

### Projects

#### 1. Tweet Generation with RNN (Keras)

Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) built with Keras to generate tweets based on user input.

Trains on tweets from different users to produce contextually similar text.

#### 2. CNN for MNIST Digit Classification

Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.

One model predicts whether an image represents the digit 7, while another classifies all ten digits (0-9).

#### 3. LSTM for Name Prediction

Uses an LSTM-based RNN to predict names from a dataset (names.txt).

The model can be trained on different text files to generate new predictions.

#### 4. Gradient Descent from Scratch

Implements gradient descent optimization on two functions of variables x1 and x2.

Demonstrates fundamental optimization techniques without external libraries.

#### 5. Classification with scikit-learn

Implements various classification models using scikit-learn, including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Linear & RBF)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Neural Networks

AdaBoost

#### 6. KNN on the Iris Dataset

Uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify flowers in the iris dataset.

Demonstrates basic supervised learning techniques.

### Requirements

To run these projects, install the following dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib

### Usage

Each project is contained in its own script or notebook.
